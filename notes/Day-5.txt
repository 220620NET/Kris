First QC is 2-4pm Monday?

How to study for QC:
    0. http://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn
    1. Refer to the curriculum. Expect to know most if not all topics listed on the agenda for the week(aka the week you're getting QC'd on)
    2. Make sure you can explain these topics in your own words. "Illusion of Competency"
        - Creating analogies
        - Building off of the topics/concepts you already know
        - Explaining to others
        - teach others 
        - Flashcards
        - The most impoortant thing here is, you're actively recalling the information instead of passively consuming
        - more senses/emotions you can recruit when you learn something the better retention it will be.
    3. How to answer technical question that asks you "what is _?"
        - What is it
        - Why do we use it
        - How you have used it
    4. "A vs. B?"
        - How are they similar?
        - How are they different?
    5. When you don't know something, can't produce an answer right away
        - First, see if you know remotely anything related to that topics
        - If so, say it
        - Even if it may come from different industry/skill, if it seems related, it's better to say that instead of IDK
        - Don't say "I don't know"
            - instead say "That's a really good question, I'll look more into it/research about it after this"
    6. Watch out on how you use technical terms
        - There are a lot of technical terms you can throw around, but, simpler is better
        - If you can explain things in simple terms that's better than throwing around a bunch of jargons that you may or may not use corrently.
        - If you don't have a full grasp on a technical term - don't use it! leave t out, substitute with plain language.

Corollary: The Soft Skills:
    - We put heavy emphasis on the delivery of the answers as much as the content itself
        - Dress
        -Camera
        - Speaking Tone/Speed/Volume - make sure you're not speaking too softly, not mumbling, not speaking too fast
        - Energy Level - This is interview/performance situation - so if you have lower energy, just be a little more extroverted for the next 10 minutes
        - Eye Contact: Don't look around (as it can be interpreted as cheating)
        - Fidgeting: be aware of your nervous habits

How to make the interviewer ask questions you know how to answer:
    - If you are not ready to talk about a certain concept/ topic - DO NOT BRING THEM UP
        - IE. "What are some class members?"
            -and you don't knwo what fields are, just .. don't even mention fields are class members
            - Lead them to the area that you know more about
    - Second, Don't start the answer by " I'm not sure about this ... but... AND THEn give a good answer"
    - Third, Believe it or not, taking 5 seconds before starting to answer doesn't feel like an eternty to the interviewer.
      If you need the time to put together a coherent answer, that the time. It's better to take the time in the beginning and come up with polished question
