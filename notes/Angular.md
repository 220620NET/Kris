## What is Angular?
Angular is a frontend framework that allows you to create Single Page Applications

## Single Page Applications
- It's a type of web application, where instead of being composed of multiple html page, the information is on a SINGLE PAGE and that PAGE is swapped to display different views.

## Advantages of SPA
- Modularity(promoting code reusability, scoping, and providing single source of truth)
- faster load times after the initial load

## Disadvantage of SPA
- initial load takes longer than server side rendering
- learning curve with tools

### Framework vs. Library
Framework are usually more opinionated on how it wants to functions
