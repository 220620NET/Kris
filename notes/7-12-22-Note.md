# Setting up a Connection Factory
    1) Create a database through the Azure Database portal or whatever you decide is needed for the particular project
        a. These services are on the cloud which allows for cheap service fees as maintenance is not your problem
    2) Use a SQL Script management system to create a schema and set of tables you will need
        a. This could be dbeaver, Azure Data Studio, or other similar programs
    3) 

# Cloud Computing
    - Cloud computing is in essence renting someone else's infrastructure/hardware
    - The demand for web presence in busnesses kept increasing but not all businesses have the resources/funds/time to manage their website/     application from the ground-up
    - Cloud service providers, such as AWS, Azure, and GCP provide the hardware, differing levels of infrastructure/services so businesses can focus on what they do best.

## Benefits
    - Ease of scaling
        - you can scale your infrastructure up or down depending on flucating demand very quickly (also possibly automatically)
    - Pay as you go princing
        - Pay for only what you use
    - You get best industry practice regarding: security, hardware maintenance

## Cloud Models
    - Public
        - These resources are open to everyone
    - Private
        - These resources are open to only you organizations
    - On-premise
        - The infrastructure you maintain
    - Hybrid
        - A mix of your infrastructure and the cloud service provider's infrastructure

## Differenct types/levels of services
    - IaaS: Infrastructure as a Service
        - Cloud Service provider provides hardware and raw computing power
            - ex: Virtual Machines
    - PaaS: Platform as a Service
        - IaaS + any software needed to run the server
            - ex: Azure SQL Server, Azure App Services
    - SaaS: Software as a Service
        - PaaS + the application
            - ex: Google Drive, gmail, etc.

## Different Types of Scaling
    - Vertical
        - You upgrade your current machine to a better spec
        - You will hit a ceiling here since there is not always a better spec on the market
    - Horizontal
        - you buy additional hardware for more power
