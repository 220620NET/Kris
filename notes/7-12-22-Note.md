# Setting up a Connection Factory
    1) Create a database through the Azure Database portal or whatever you decide is needed for the particular project
        a. These services are on the cloud which allows for cheap service fees as maintenance is not your problem
    2) Use a SQL Script management system to create a schema and set of tables you will need
        a. This could be dbeaver, Azure Data Studio, or other similar programs
    3) add the Sqlclient package into your project using
        - `dotnet add package Microsoft.Data.Sqlclient` or `dotnet add package System.data.SqlClient`
    4) 

# Cloud Computing
    - Cloud computing is in essence renting someone else's infrastructure/hardware
    - The demand for web presence in busnesses kept increasing but not all businesses have the resources/funds/time to manage their website/     application from the ground-up
    - Cloud service providers, such as AWS, Azure, and GCP provide the hardware, differing levels of infrastructure/services so businesses can focus on what they do best.

## Benefits
    - Ease of scaling
        - you can scale your infrastructure up or down depending on flucating demand very quickly (also possibly automatically)
    - Pay as you go princing
        - Pay for only what you use
    - You get best industry practice regarding: security, hardware maintenance

## Cloud Models
    - Public
        - These resources are open to everyone
    - Private
        - These resources are open to only you organizations
    - On-premise
        - The infrastructure you maintain
    - Hybrid
        - A mix of your infrastructure and the cloud service provider's infrastructure

## Differenct types/levels of services
    - IaaS: Infrastructure as a Service
        - Cloud Service provider provides hardware and raw computing power
            - ex: Virtual Machines
    - PaaS: Platform as a Service
        - IaaS + any software needed to run the server
            - ex: Azure SQL Server, Azure App Services
    - SaaS: Software as a Service
        - PaaS + the application
            - ex: Google Drive, gmail, etc.

## Different Types of Scaling
    - Vertical
        - You upgrade your current machine to a better spec
        - You will hit a ceiling here since there is not always a better spec on the market
    - Horizontal
        - you buy additional hardware for more power

## Disconnected Architechture
Instead of using the DataReader which was demonstrated last week, we can use DataAdapter to create a local database copy. We can add rows and tables to this local copy without affecting the remote database and if we want to update the remote we must call the Update() method. This disconnected architecture is best for bulk commands. This fits in the Unit of Work design pattern, as even though it takes in a bulk set of commands it will operate each one individually. The steps for operating the disconnected Architecture are as follows:
    1) Create a new DataSet
    2) call a new SqlDataAdapter("select*from <table>", connection)
    3) Fill the data Adapter with the Fill(Dataset, "title");
    4) using a reference type create another DataTable equating it to a DataSet.Table["title"]
    5) Check if the table is null and then add a new row
        a. use DataRow row = table.NewRow()
        b. use Add()
    6)Use CommandBuilder with the dataadapter as the parameter
    7) insert a command using SqlCommand and the GetInsertCommand() method of the CommandBuilder
    8) finally update the table by 


# HTTP
## Overview
    - HTTP: Hyper Text Transfer Protocol
    - This is how we access websites like facebook and Google
    - The computer sends a request to some server or database to read or interact with a server
## Request Lifecycle
    - Send from client to server
    - 3 Parts:
        - Start line
            - Method -describes action to be performed
            - Target - describes where to send the request
        - Header
            - Meta data
            - EX: content type - what data type the body has
        - Body
            - Data you want the server to process
## Verbs, Methods
    - Describe what action the client wants the server to perform on a given resources
    - Common Verbs
        - GET
            - get resource
        - POST
            - Create a new resource
        - PUT
            - update resource
        - DELETE
            - Delete resource
        - HEAD
            - Returns just the headers of a get response
    - Less Common verbs: connect, options, trace, patch

## Response
    - From, server to client
        - Status line
            -Contains HTTP status codes of describing what happened when interacting with the server
        - Headers
        - Body
## Status Codes
    - Staus codes give a short descrption of whether an interaction is successful or not
    - Status codes are grouped by their number:
        - 1xx -informational ("Mkay")
        - 2xx -  Communicating success ("Success")
        - 3xx - redirection ("We moved that")
        - 4xx - errors that are the client's fault, client side errors ("Your fault")
        - 5xx - errors that are the server's fault, server side errors ("My bad")
## Common Status Codes
    - 400 Bad Request
    - 404 - Resource Not Available/Found
    - 401 - Unauthorized
    - 451 - Unavailable for Legal Reasons
    - 200 - Ok for get
    - 201 - Created for post
    - 204 not content for put and delete

## DNS
    - The Domain Name System(DNS) is the phonebook of the internet
    - Humans access information online through domain names, like nytimes.com or espn.com. Web browsers interact through Internet Protocol(IP) addresses
    - DNS translates domain names to IP addresses so browsers can load Internet resources
