Arrays:
    - arrays start with an index of 0 
    - when declared with a new arrayTyp[int] will save that many spaces in memory 32-bit space each
    - Find method for arrays
    - Array.Copy method can copy a section of the array
    - Array.Clone method to create a shallow copy of the array
    - int[,] <name> = new int[1,2] to create a multi-dimensional array
    - Jagged Array: int[][] <name> = new int[1][]
    - You can also pre-fill the array for a multi-dimensional array by doing {},{},{}
        - the number of braces is determined by the first integer in the declaration of the array type;
